# RiotGamesHelper

## By Damjan Petrovic

 A simple python script to get stats and process them in a way to help you understand the game more and help you get better or make better decisions. In this application we are going to use the Riot Games API to grab the information and then self define some algorithms to process the data and display it. Maybe if the motivation is high we are going to set up and configure a nice UI but at the start we are going to default to the console.

## Prerequisites

- Install Request Package

  Because we are going to use the Riot Games API to get the data we will need the request module provided by python. You can simply get it with the Python packet manager by typing:

  ```
  pip install requests
  ```

  

- Riot Games API Key

  Next to access the API we will need an API-Key. To get this you will need to register your Riot Games account as a developer account. To do this simply go to https://developer.riotgames.com/ and register your account. At first you can simply use the provided API key that gets reset every 24h.
